habitrpg-boss-button
====================

Chrome extension to create a "boss button" to remove game-looking elements from HabitRPG, permitting its safe use at work or in class. 

###Installation###

To install, simply [download habitrpg-boss-button.crx](https://github.com/tjwds/habitrpg-boss-button/raw/master/habitrpg-boss-button.crx) and drag and drop the file to your extension page.  

**Note**: this is simply a stop-gap to provide this feature for those who want it as soon as possible; as I understand it, the folks over at HabitRPG intend to turn this into a site feature. 

Sorry that it's not in the chrome store—that costs money, yo—but you can look at all of the code here to be sure that it's not mallacious.
